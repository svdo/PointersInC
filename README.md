Pointers in C
=============

Nowadays young programmers are not always exposed to lower level details like
pointers and explicit memory management anymore. I think it's good to have a
basic understanding of these things, even when you're normally programming in
Clojure. And my colleages were enthusiastic to learn more, so we spend a night
going through the material in this repo.
